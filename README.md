# NetworkFlowForBipartiteMatching
Program Assignment 3 for CSS449 Algorithm Design and Analysis

## Description
- Implement the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm using the shortest augmenting paths method to find bipartite matching.
- Run in O(n<sup>5/2</sup>) time

## File Format
- Must be named `program3data.txt`
- The first line will hold the number of nodes n, which will be even. The next n/2 lines will store the names of items to be matched in the “left” set. Then, n/2 further lines will store the names of items to be matching in the “right” set.
- Next, the number of edges will be stored and following that will be the edges (one per line) indexing the nodes using 1-based indexing.
- Use `program3data.txt` in this repo as reference.


## Note
- Used adjacency matrix to represent the graph
- Written in Java
